## The forever ghost lore
**Warning**: This document is classified, Accessing this document without authorization may cost you your life.

Forever ghosts are able to produce an infinite amount of 24 karat gold coins with pure plated silver as a tophat, Which leads to them having infinite wealth. They are not too greedy and they share as much as needed with the world. However, They are not aware of the worth of these coins.

Forever ghosts stay around for nearly forever, Making them extremely smart. However, They are bound to make mistakes.

It is possible that a forever ghost forgets information that they obtained in the past 24 hours. Past that point however, They cannot forget it at all costs.

Forever ghosts' brains are designed in such a way to prevent them from getting bored or sensing the passage of time.

Forever ghosts are extremely active and adventorous.

**The source of the infinite energy of forever ghosts is █████████.**
<!---
It's actually green tea.

Forever ghosts usually feel very lonely, But they become loyal to people who gets them out of loneliness.

Possessing objects are easy for forever ghosts, But they are unable to un-possess it easily afterwards and they will most likely need physical help to do so.

A forever ghost is made out of a silhoutte, Which contains three parts:
1. The head, Which is the main source of their thoughts
2. The tophat, Which could be removed and is made of ghost semi-silicon, But costs the remover their life, And most likely their afterlife. **We recommend to never touch a forever ghost's tophat.**
3. The cape, Which is made out of ghost semi-silicon.

### What is a ghost silicon?
Ghost silicon is a very special element that is touchable by both forever ghosts and humans and acts as infinite weight for forever ghosts. Ghost semi-silicon, Is is a similar substance to ghost silicon. However, It acts as "compressed air" for humans. It could be grabbed by any living being, And suprisingly, It could also phase through walls.

### How a forever ghost sleeps
This topic is very important, And skipping over it may cost you your life. When forever ghosts sleep and you wake them up, They become very deadly and angry. They could haunt you to death aswell.

1. When a forever ghost sleeps without a ghost-silicon-covered surface, It's called a hover. Hover is the lightest form of sleep a forever ghost could have.
2. When a forever ghost sleeps on a surface covered with ghost silicon, It's called normal sleeping. They could be woken up from their sleep a bit harder.
3. When a forever ghost dies, They cannot be woken up at all costs nor be seen or touched at all, And people will start to forget that they actually existed. But after a while ( 10 minutes to 1 eternity ), People's memories are restored and the forever ghost snaps back to existence.


# If you read this document until here, You might have woken up a forever ghost. Cover yourself with ghost silicon and seek shelter.
