### How houston found the cafe
Houston was desperate for a chance to prove himself, Lost in the woods, Sorrounded by darkness. He found a strange light source, And when he went closer, He heard people/animals chatting. He said "What is going on? Is this a ceremony?" and he got closer. When he realized what it was, It was too late. He had found a shelter, That he would seek for the rest of his life.

### How houston decided to live in the cafe's basement
Houston was looking everywhere, For a hidden room, Or a dark spot to rest in when he saw the markings on the floor. He immediately noticed that there was probably a blocked off room.
