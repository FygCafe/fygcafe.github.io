## About us
Fyg Cafe was opened in an unknown era, by the Fyg forest spirit. She employs the local residents, usually red foxes or hedgehogs since they have difficulty finding employment elsewhere. She hand-sews linen and cotton pinafore aprons for the employees, letting them choose a custom embroidered pocket design.

## Our employees
 - Fyg: A forest spirit, she is the Owner and Founder of the Fyg Cafe. She manages all the employees and on special days she will appear physically in the Cafe to chat with customers. She has a calming demeanor and her favorite menu order is Malasadas with Brown Sugar Milk Tea.
 - Moise: An old hedgehog that has worked with Fyg for almost two centuries. His slow aging is attributed to being closely associated with Fyg, she values him as an employee and gives him the option every year to end his employment. Moise's apron design is of his family tree, updated every 10 years. He is a manager directly under Fyg.
 - Ellyn: A red fox who first came to Fyg Cafe after being ruthlessly bullied for the scar tissue along her tail where fur doesn't grow. Fyg took her in as an employee and the bullies have since been disposed of. Ellyn's apron design is a bundle of lavender and sunflowers. She is a pastry expert.
 - Linet: The youngest employee at Fyg Cafe, she is a hedgehog who was caught stealing berries from the kitchen as a poor child and Fyg employed her and gave her family a new life. Linet's apron design is of her favorite drink, Taro Milk Tea. Her specialty is boba.
 - Huon: A hedgehog who is mute and deaf after a traumatizing incident involving wasps. They have a passion for tea and regularly hosts tea ceremonies every 2nd Sunday of the month. Huon's apron design is of Venus and Mars circling each other.
 - Tybalt: A red fox who is a design expert and helps Fyg renovate the Cafe and marketing whenever necessary, he isn't a regular employee but enjoys his passion for design endlessly since Fyg supplies anything he needs to put his ideas in reality. 

All of Fyg Cafe employees are trained extensively to give the best service. Their families are given comfortable livelihoods and continue to receive benefits even after employment ends. All employees are trained in the top three most common Fillorian languages, as well as Sign Language to provide for hearing disabled customers.

> In addition to the front of the Cafe where pastries and drinks are served, it has a hidden back room where certain customers are allowed to spend the night. Fyg Cafe always wants people to go back home to their families, but if somebody doesn't have a family to go back to then Fyg will provide a family for them. It is one of the many kindnesses that the Cafe provides.
